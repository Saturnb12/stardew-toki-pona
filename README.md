# Stardew Valley toki pona translation

This is a fan-made translation of Stardew Valley to toki pona. Please notice it is still in a very early development.

## Contributing

Of course, you are required to have familiarity speaking toki pona.

All the translations are directly written in JSON files.

You're empowered to translate several strings of text in a single commit, but they should all be related, like coming from the same file, game scene or character.

Only _nimi pu_ and _nimi ku suli_ are accepted, thought there may be exceptions in certain cases. Rare _nasins_ usage are free to be discussed in the issues.

All characters, places and objects names must be the same in all texts. If unsure, most (if not all) names are in `assets/Strings/`; for example, for the list of characters names check `assets/Strings/NPCNames.json`. If a name still hasn't been translated, feel free to do it yourself!

Proofreading is also needed. Feel free to change any text already translated.

When editing images, use the same font style and colors of the source.

Only images containing text are neccesary. It is helpful to remove any images you find without text.

### For programmers

The structure of the project is based on Content Patcher. There might be issues with format or missing files that I have missed, or might cause the mod to break. If you detect flaws in the structure, please leave an issue or pull request.

## Installing

You need to setup SMAPI and install Content Patcher to run this mod. Read [this guide](https://www.stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Player_Guide/Getting_Started). Then place the project folder in your system's `Mods` path.


## Contact

Contact me in Discord (`@velho.sieni`) if needed.

To be fair, I am a horrible project manager. All feedback in the workflow and documentation is appreciated.
